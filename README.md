**MCP Client Chatbot** is a versatile chat interface that supports various AI model providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). 

It is also the first known speech-based chatbot with integrated MCP Server support, enabling real-time multimodal interactions.

Our mission is to build the **most powerful tool-using chatbot**, combining the best of language models and tool orchestration.  

We aim to create diverse UX and features that allow LLMs to actively use tools — such as `@tool` mentions for direct invocation,  
enabling **speech-based chat to access and use MCP server tools**, quick tool presets for fast selection,  
and the upcoming **workflow with tools** feature for multi-step automation.


> Built with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this app adopts modern patterns for building AI chat interfaces. Leverage the power of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to seamlessly integrate external tools into your chat experience.


**🌟 Open Source Project**
MCP Client Chatbot is a 100% community-driven open source project.

## Demo

Here are some quick examples of how you can use MCP Client Chatbot:


### 🧩 Browser Automation with Playwright MCP

![playwright-demo](./docs/images/preview-1.gif)

**Example:** Control a web browser using Microsoft's [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) tool.

Sample prompt:

```prompt
Please go to GitHub and visit the cgoinglove profile.
Open the mcp-client-chatbot project.
Then, click on the README.md file.
After that, close the browser.
Finally, tell me how to install the package.
```

### ⚡️ Quick Tool Mentions (`@`)

![mention](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80dd48-1d95-4938-b0d8-431c02ec2a53)

Quickly call any registered MCP tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.  
No need to memorize — just type `@` and pick from the list!

You can also control how tools are used with the new **Tool Choice Mode**:

- **Auto:** Tools are automatically called by the model when needed.
- **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling any tool.
- **None:** Disables all tool usage.

Toggle modes anytime with the shortcut `⌘P`.

> This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# If you don't have pnpm:
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Quick Start (Local Version) 🚀

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create the environment variable file and fill in your .env values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. (Optional) If you already have PostgreSQL running and .env is configured, skip this step
pnpm docker:pg

# 4. Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm dev

# 6. (Optional) Build & start for local production-like testing
pnpm build:local && pnpm start
# Use build:local for local start to ensure correct cookie settings
```


### Quick Start (Docker Compose Version) 🐳

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create environment variable files and fill in the required values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. Build and start all services (including PostgreSQL) with Docker Compose
pnpm docker-compose:up

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.

---

### Environment Variables

The `pnpm i` command generates a `.env` file. Add your API keys there.

```dotenv
# === LLM Provider API Keys ===
# You only need to enter the keys for the providers you plan to use
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=****
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
XAI_API_KEY=****
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=****
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=****
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api

# Secret for Better Auth (generate with: npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=****

# === Database ===
# If you don't have PostgreSQL running locally, start it with: pnpm docker:pg
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name

# Whether to use file-based MCP config (default: false)
FILE_BASED_MCP_CONFIG=false

# === OAuth Settings (Optional) ===
# Fill in these values only if you want to enable Google/GitHub login
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

### MCP Server Setup

You can connect MCP tools via:

1. **UI Setup:** Go to http://localhost:3000/mcp and configure through the interface.
2. **Custom Logic:** Edit `./custom-mcp-server/index.ts` to implement your own logic, this also doesn't run on vercel or docker.
3. **File based for local dev:** make .mcp-config.json and put your servers in there. Only works in local dev, no docker or vercel env variable required. For example 
```jsonc
// .mcp-config.json
{
  "playwright":  {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
}
```
